Hello and welcome back!

In this post, we'll be discussing about another important data representation technique - The frequency domain (using Fourier Transforms). But before starting out with this representation, it is essential to know what exactly is Fourier Transform.

According to [www.thefouriertransform.com](https://www.thefouriertransform.com/) - 
> The Fourier Transform is a tool that breaks a waveform (a function or signal) into an alternate representation, characterized by sine and cosines. The Fourier Transform shows that any waveform can be re-written as the sum of sinusoidal functions.
One example of this is (taken from the previous post) -
